# Intro

> Currently listing all that I want to read before writing

- code cohesion
- code coupling
- project documentation
	- Code should be written in a way that promotes `readability` and is easy to understand for other developers.
	- Good documentation can take different forms such as comments, documentation sites, and API documentation.
	- Comments should provide meaningful explanations and not simply describe the syntax of the code.
	- Using `type-hints` in Python code improves clarity and understanding.
	- `docstrings` can be used to document functions, methods, classes, and modules, and tools like Auto `docstring` can assist in generating them.
	- use of `mkdocs` alongside of `docstrings`
- code diagnosis
- UML
- SOLID
- CRUD
- Programming Patterns
	- Collection Classes 
	- Junction Classes 
- Object structure
	- Service
	- Interface
	- Implementation (data and code)
- OOD Object Oriented Design
- OOA Object Oriented Analysis
