- [00:01](https://youtu.be/5DTxuMDYvNc?t=1s) üï∑Ô∏è Overview of WebCrawler System Design Question

  - A WebCrawler is crucial for tasks like indexing for search engines, data mining, and archiving.
  - Functional requirements include crawling related pages and avoiding duplicate pages.
  - Nonfunctional requirements involve prioritizing URLs and being polite to avoid overloading sites.

- [01:27](https://youtu.be/5DTxuMDYvNc?t=87s) üìä Estimation and Storage Capacity Calculation

  - Understanding the amount of data to be stored monthly, yearly, and over several years.
  - Calculation of storage requirements based on average page size and monthly page count.
  - Conversion of storage needs into petabytes for scalability considerations.

- [03:04](https://youtu.be/5DTxuMDYvNc?t=184s) üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Components

  - Exploring components like Seed URLs, HTML fetcher, HTML parser, and duplicate detection.
  - Consideration of scalable solutions for DNS resolution and caching.
  - Evaluation of storage options such as column-oriented databases and distributed file systems.

- [07:02](https://youtu.be/5DTxuMDYvNc?t=422s) üîó URL Extraction and Modular Services

  - Discussing the role of URL extractor and the potential use of Kafka for extensibility.
  - Importance of modular services like image downloaders and analytic services for system flexibility.
  - Utilizing tools like Redis Bloom and Memcached for implementing caching mechanisms.

- [09:19](https://youtu.be/5DTxuMDYvNc?t=559s) ‚öôÔ∏è URL Frontier and Prioritization

  - Detailed explanation of URL prioritization and politeness in the URL Frontier.
  - Implementation of front queue prioritizer and back queue selector for prioritizing URLs.
  - Ensuring politeness by delaying requests and avoiding excessive requests to specific domains.
