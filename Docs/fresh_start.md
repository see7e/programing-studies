## 42 related topics 

1. **C Programming:** Understanding the C programming language is crucial, as most low-level projects at 42 are done in C. Focus on data types, pointers, memory management, and the standard library functions.

2. **Memory Management:** Learn about memory allocation, pointers, and dynamic memory management using functions like `malloc` and `free`.

3. **Bit Manipulation:** Study bitwise operations and bit manipulation techniques, which are often used in low-level programming for tasks like optimizing code and handling hardware registers.

4. **Assembly Language:** Familiarize yourself with assembly language, as some projects may require writing inline assembly or understanding assembly code for system calls and optimization.

5. **Operating System Fundamentals:** Gain knowledge about how operating systems work, including process management, file systems, and system calls.

6. **File I/O:** Learn how to read and write files at a low level using functions like `open`, `read`, and `write`.

7. **Data Structures:** Understand data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues, which are often used in low-level projects.

8. **System Calls:** Study the system calls of the operating system you're working on (e.g., Linux system calls) to interact with the kernel and perform various tasks.

9. **Debugging:** Master debugging techniques and tools for low-level code, like using `gdb` for debugging C and assembly code.

10. **Compilation Process:** Learn about the compilation process, including the preprocessor, compiler, assembler, linker, and how they transform source code into executable files.

11. **Makefiles:** Understand how to create and use Makefiles for building and managing projects with multiple source files.

12. **Hardware Concepts:** Familiarize yourself with hardware-related concepts, such as registers, memory management units, and system architecture.

13. **Optimization Techniques:** Explore methods for optimizing code for performance, including loop unrolling, inline assembly, and using compiler-specific flags.

14. **Low-Level Libraries:** Get to know low-level libraries like the Standard C Library (libc) and system-specific libraries (e.g., the Linux API) that can help in your projects.

> [!TIP]
> to implement
> - Using `type-hints` in Python code improves clarity and understanding.
>   ```python
>   def greeting(name: str) -> str:
>     return 'Hello ' + name
>   ```
> 	- `docstrings` can be used to document functions, methods, classes, and modules, and tools like > Auto `docstring` can assist in generating them.
> 	- use of `mkdocs` alongside of `docstrings`
