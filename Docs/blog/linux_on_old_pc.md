# Installing Linux on an old PC

I've always been kind with using old hardware, the feeling of the old movies where the hacker is using a old computer to hack the mainframe is probably where the desire of being a programmer started.

But life is a interesting thing, it brings mostly want you think that you don't want, but is mostly what you need. So my path taked some turns but now I've ended up with a old (pretty new) Dell Latitude XT, a tablet PC from 2007.

It already had Windows 10 Pro installed but I didn't wanted another MS machine, so this is how I installed Linux on it, what I've faced and how I solved it.

(new updates soon)
