# Intro

Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based, or virtual, representation of something, such as virtual applications, servers, storage and networks. It is the single most effective way to reduce IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility for all size businesses.

Can increase IT agility, flexibility and scalability while creating significant cost savings. Greater workload mobility, increased performance and availability of resources, automated operations â€“ theyâ€™re all benefits of virtualization that make IT simpler to manage and less costly to own and operate. Additional benefits include:

- Reduce capital and operating costs.
- Minimize or eliminate downtime.
- Increase IT productivity, efficiency, agility and responsiveness.
- Provision applications and resources faster.
- Enable business continuity and disaster recovery.
- Simplify data center management.
- Build a true Software-Defined Data Center.


## Virtualization Types

There's two types of virtualization, the first one is the **Hardware Virtualization** and the second one is **Software Virtualization**.

### Hardware Virtualization

Is the actual physical components of the computer, like the CPU, RAM, HDD, etc. The virtualization is done by an element called **Hypervisor** (i.e. VMWare esxi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Citrix XenServer, etc). The vitualization is done by the hypervisor, which is a software that runs on the hardware and allows the creation of virtual machines.

### Software Virtualization

Is the virtualization of the software, like the OS, applications, etc. The virtualization is done by an element called **Virtual Machine** (i.e. VirtualBox, VMWare Workstation, etc). The virtualization is done by the virtual machine, which is a software that runs on the OS and allows the creation of virtual machines.

## Virtualization Benefits

- **Server Consolidation:** The ability to run multiple virtual machines on a single server, with each virtual machine sharing the resources of that one physical computer across multiple environments. Different virtual machines can run different operating systems and multiple applications on the same physical computer.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Virtualization reduces the number of physical servers, which reduces the energy required to power and cool them. Save energy and go green with virtualization.
- **Faster Server Provisioning:** Provision new servers in minutes instead of days.
- **Reduced Hardware Vendor Lock-In:** Virtualization reduces the need for physical infrastructure, which reduces vendor lock-in and enables you to shop around for the best software and hardware deals.
- **Improved Business Continuity:** Securely backup and migrate entire virtual environments with no interruption in service. Eliminate planned downtime and recover immediately from unplanned issues.
- **Improved Responsiveness:** Provision applications faster and improve application performance with the freedom to choose the best hardware and software options for your organization.
- **Faster Desktop Provisioning:** Deliver desktops faster and more flexibly to branch offices, temporary employees or remote employees. Enable users to access their desktops from anywhere.
- **Reduced Downtime:** Maintain your business continuity with improved disaster recovery capabilities and simplified data center management.
- **Improved Desktop Manageability & Security:** Deploy, manage and monitor secure desktop environments that users can access locally or remotely, with or without a network connection, on almost any standard desktop, laptop or tablet PC.
