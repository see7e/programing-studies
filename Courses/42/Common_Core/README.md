## [Codespace deployment pipeline](../../../Docs/GH-action_docker-image.md)

In order to implement a Codespace deployment pipeline, to improve the development experience, I've created a workflow that creates a Codespace when a branch with `42` as its name is created.

The workflow is triggered by the `create` event, and it uses the `microsoft/create-codespace-action` action to create the Codespace and is directly linked to the `.devcontainer.json` file, which is the configuration file for the Codespace.
